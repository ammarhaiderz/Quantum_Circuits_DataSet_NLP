CHARACTERIZATION OF PERMUTATION GATES IN THE THIRD LEVEL
OF THE CLIFFORD HIERARCHY
ZHIYANG HE, LUKE ROBITAILLE, AND XINYU TAN
Abstract. The Clifford hierarchy is a fundamental structure in quantum computation whose
mathematical properties are not fully understood. In this work, we characterize permutation gates—
unitaries which permute the 2n basis states—in the third level of the hierarchy. We prove that any
permutation gate in the third level must be a product of Toffoli gates in what we define as staircase
form, up to left and right multiplications by Clifford permutations. We then present necessary and
sufficient conditions for a staircase form permutation gate to be in the third level of the Clifford
hierarchy. As a corollary, we construct a family of non-semi-Clifford permutation gat

1. Introduction
The Clifford hierarchy is a ubiquitous structure in quantum computation which classifies unitary
operations based on their conjugate actions on the Pauli group. Precisely, the first level C1 of
the hierarchy CH is the Pauli group P, and its subsequent levels are defined recursively: Ck is
the set of all unitaries U such that UPU† ∈Ck−1 for all Pauli operators P. Within CH, gates 
in the third level are of unique importance to the study of fault-tolerant quantum computation
(FTQC) [Sho95, Sho96, Got97], as established by several foundational works. The Gottesman-  
Knill theorem [Got98] states that any circuits made of Pauli and Clifford gates, which are the first
two levels of CH, can be efficiently simulated by a classical compute

Our first main result, which was presented in an earlier version of this paper [HRT24], states
that every permutation in Csym
3
can be written in staircase form.
Result 1 (Theorem 3.2). If π ∈C3 is a permutation gate, then there exist Clifford permutations
ϕ1, ϕ2 and a product µ of Toffoli gates in staircase form such that µ ∈C3 and π = ϕ1µϕ2.    
We remark that there are permutations in staircase form which are not in C3.
To derive a
full characterization, we consider bilinear products defined over vectors of Fn
2, which we denote
by juxtaposition.

expense of a large number of ancilla qubits. This extra ancilla cost is, in fact, optimal: using the
characterization with descending multiplications, we show the following lower bound.        
Result 4 (Theorem 5.9). Any permutation gate in C3 with an output bit represented by a poly-
nomial of degree at least k must be supported on at least 2k −1 qubits.
1.2. Future directions. Combining these four results, our characterization discovers and delin-
eates a novel design space within Csym

.
By constructing descending multiplications, which are
easier to reason with than Toffoli circuits, we can derive permutation gates in C3 which encode
different classical computations. These computations can then be implemented in FTQC via gate
teleportation, where

In Section A, we show that 7 is the smallest number of qubits for which there exists a non-semi-
Clifford permutation in C3. In Section B, we classify semi-Clifford permutations and where they
appear in the Clifford hierarchy.
Remark 1.1. This work supersedes an earlier version [HRT24] by the same authors. The prior  
work established only Result 1, which gives a necessary but not sufficient condition for a gate to be
in Csym
3
. By contrast, the present paper provides substantially stronger results. In particular, we 
strengthen the condition to be both necessary and sufficient (Result 2), and as an application, we
construct an infinite family of Csym
3
gates whose inverses are not in particular levels of the Clifford
hierarchy (Result 3).

Definition 2.3 (Semi-Clifford and generalized semi-Clifford gates). A gate is semi-Clifford if it
can be written as ϕ1dϕ2 for some Clifford gates ϕ1, ϕ2 and a diagonal gate d. A gate is generalized
semi-Clifford if it can be written as ϕ1πdϕ2 for some Clifford gates ϕ1, ϕ2, a permutation gate π,
and a diagonal gate d.
Observe that the inverse of a semi-Clifford gate is semi-Clifford. The inverse of a generalized
semi-Clifford gate is generalized semi-Clifford, as we can write (ϕ1πdϕ2)−1 = ϕ−1
2 π−1(πd−1π−1)ϕ−1

and πd−1π−1 is diagonal. If we multiply a semi-Clifford (resp. generalized semi-Clifford) element
on the left or right by a Clifford gate, the resulting operator is still semi-Clifford (resp. generalized
semi-Clifford).

It can be verified with a computer program that G ∈C3. If G were semi-Clifford, then we would
have G−1 ∈C3 by Proposition 2.5. However, a computer calculation shows that G−1 /∈C3 (in    
particular, G−1X7G /∈C2). Thus, G is not semi-Clifford.
□
This 7-qubit operator is the smallest known example of a non-semi-Clifford operator in C3.  
[ZCC08] showed that for n ≤3, all elements of C3 are semi-Clifford. Recently, [AC25] showed that
for n = 4, all elements of C3 are semi-Clifford. For n = 5 or 6, it is an open problem whether there
is a C3 operator that is non-semi-Clifford. We make partial progress on this problem in Section A
by showing that all permutation gates in C3 on at most six qubits are semi-Clifford.

Proposition 2.15 (Clifford permutations). For any n × n invertible matrix M over F2 and any 
vector w, the permutation gate sending |v⟩7→|Mv + w⟩is Clifford.
Conversely, any Clifford
permutation is of this form for some M and w.
Proof. For the first claim, it is clear that |v⟩7→|Mv + w⟩is a permutation, which we denote π. To
show that π is Clifford, it suffices to show that πXiπ−1, πZiπ−1 ∈Pn. For πXiπ−1, it sends  
|v⟩7→|M−1(v −w)⟩7→|M−1(v −w) + ei⟩7→|M(M−1(v −w) + ei) + w⟩= |v + Mei⟩.
Therefore πXiπ−1 is equivalent to a product of X gates. For πZiπ−1, it sends
|v⟩7→|M−1(v −w)⟩7→(−1)e⊤
i M−1(v−w)|M−1(v −w)⟩7→(−1)e⊤
i M−1(v−w)|v⟩.
We can rewrite this as |v⟩7→(−1)−e⊤

3. Staircase form representations of C3 permutations
We begin by presenting the most important definition of our work.
Definition 3.1 (Staircase form Toffoli circuits). A product of pairwise distinct Toffoli gates is said
to be in staircase form if each gate TOFi,j,k in the product has i < j < k and the target qubits are
in nondecreasing order in the order that the gates are applied. See Figure 3 for an example.

Note that a staircase form Toffoli circuit is unique up to ordering of gates with the same target.

Proof. First we show that the intersections of kernels of Ai, namely ∩i ker(Ai), is non-empty.
Assume for the sake of contradiction it is empty, and let v be a non-zero vector which maximizes
the number of indices i for which Aiv = 0. Take j with Ajv ̸= 0, we see that Ai(Ajv) = AjAivv = 0
for any i with Aiv = 0, and Aj(Ajv) = A2
jv = 0. Therefore, Ajv is in more kernels ker(Ai) than
v is, contradicting our assumption on v. Hence, there must exist non-zero v such that for all i,
Aiv = 0.
We now induct on n. Consider the (n−1)-dimensional vector space V/{v}. Since v ∈∩i ker(Ai), 
all linear transformations Ai are well-defined on V/{v} and satisfy AiAj = AjAi and A2      
i = 0. So
there exists a basis v1+{v}, . . . , vn−1+{v} of V/{v} in which all the A

Lemma 3.3 (Reducing C3 permutations). For any permutation gate π ∈C3, there exist Clifford  
permutations ϕ1, ϕ2 such that the following is true. Let τ = ϕ1πϕ2. Then τ |0n⟩= |0n⟩and for
each i, we have τ |ei⟩= |ei⟩and τXiτ −1 is given by |v⟩7→|v + Aiv + ei⟩for some strictly lower
triangular matrix Ai over F2.
Proof. By multiplying π by suitable X’s on the left, we assume without loss of generality that
π|0n⟩= |0n⟩.
Since π ∈C3 is a permutation, each πXjπ−1 is a Clifford permutation. Then by Proposition 2.15
we can write πXjπ−1 as |v⟩7→|v + Ajv + bj⟩for some matrix Aj and vector bj over F2. Since   
X2
j = I and XiXj = XjXi, we have A2
j = 0 and AiAj = AjAi. By Lemma 3.4, these conditions
imply that there is some basis in which the Aj are simultaneo

We are now ready to prove Theorem 3.2, restated below for convenience.
Theorem 3.2. Suppose π ∈C3 is a permutation gate. Then there exist Clifford permutations ϕ1, ϕ2
and a staircase form permutation µ ∈C3 such that π = ϕ1µϕ2.
Proof. By Lemma 3.3, we can assume without loss of generality that π |0n⟩= |0n⟩and for each 
i ∈[n], π |ei⟩= |ei⟩and πXiπ−1 is given by |v⟩7→|v + Aiv + ei⟩for some strictly lower triangular
matrix Ai over F2.
We now show that for any v, if π|v⟩= |w⟩, then α(v) = α(w). Suppose for the sake of contra- 
diction that this is false. We know it is true for v = 0n or en, so α(v) < n in any counterexample.
Take the largest k for which there exists a counterexample with α(v) = k. We know π|ek⟩= |ek⟩,
so v ̸= ek. Let u ̸= 0n be such

4. Descending multiplications
As we proved that every permutation in C3 can be written in staircase form, in this section 
we show sufficient conditions for a staircase form permutation to be in C3. Previously we have
been working with Fn
2 as a vector space without any multiplicative structure. Our next definition
captures bilinear products defined over Fn
2 which encode staircase form Toffoli circuits in C3.
Definition 4.1 (Descending multiplications). A map Fn
2 × Fn
2 →Fn
2, denoted by juxtaposition, is
called a descending multiplication if
• it is linear in each coordinate

4.1. Helper lemmas.
Lemma 4.7. Let π ∈C3 be a permutation. Then π is in staircase form if and only if the following
conditions hold:
• π|0⟩= |0⟩,
• π|ei⟩= |ei⟩for all i ∈[n], and
• for any vector v with at least two 1s, the indices of the first two 1s in v and π(v) are the
same.
Proof. We use the equivalent characterization of staircase form permutations in Lemma 3.7.  
For the “if” direction, consider the polynomial representation (b1, . . . , bn) of π−1. We know from
Lemma 2.13 that bi has degree at most 2 for all i. The condition π−1(0) = 0 yields that the constant
term of bi is 0 for all i. Moreover, for all i ∈[n], the condition π−1(ei) = ei yields that the linear
term of bi is ai. Thus we can write bk = ak + qk where qk is a sum of monomia

We can similarly show that π(a)+π(c)+π(a)π(c) = π(w) and π(b)+π(c)+π(b)π(c) = π(v +w).      
Further, since π(c)π(c) = 0, we have
π(v) + π(w) + π(v)π(w) = π(a) + π(b) + π(a)π(b) + π(a) + π(c) + π(a)π(c)
+ (π(a) + π(b) + π(a)π(b))(π(a) + π(c) + π(a)π(c))

Proof. We first note that Equation (4.1) implies the three conditions in Lemma 4.7. In particular,

where the last equality follows from Equation (4.3) and the induction hypothesis. Observe that
π(vij) = π((ei + ej + vij) + (ei + ej))
= (ei + ej)(ei + ej + eiej) + (ei + ej) + (ei + ej + eiej)
= eiej.
(4.6)
We can show that π(x) = ei+P
j∈T eiej via a simple induction on |T|, as well as using Equation (4.3)
and the facts that e2
i = 0, π(ei) = ei, and π(vij) = eiej repeatedly. Now continuing Equation (4.5):

5. A family of non-semi-Clifford Permutations
Utilizing our characterization of C3 permutations as descending multiplications, we construct
an infinite family of permutation gates {Uk}k≥3 in Definition 5.1 and prove in Theorem 5.4 that
every Uk is non-semi-Clifford in C3. This family of gates disproves both of Anderson’s conjectures
(restated in Conjecture 2.18 and Conjecture 2.19 for convenience). We study the smallest case
of k = 3 in Section 5.3, and show that this 7-qubit permutation U3 is in fact conjugate to the
Gottesman–Mochon example by a Clifford operator.

integer k ≥3, let n = 2k −1. We label a basis of Fn
2 as eS for nonempty subsets S ⊆[

5.4. Lower bound on the number of qubits required for a C3 permutation. From Theo-
rem 5.4, we know that Uk is a C3 permutation on 2k −1 qubits that contains a degree-k monomial
in its polynomial representation. Our next result shows that any such permutation in C3 must be
supported on at least 2k −1 qubits.
Theorem 5.9 (Lower bound on the number of qubits required for a C3 permutation). If π is a C3
permutation such that there is a degree-k monomial somewhere in the polynomial representation of
π, then n ≥2k −1; this bound is sharp for all k ≥3.
We prove Theorem 5.9 by taking advantage of the one-to-one correspondence between descending
multiplications (Proposition 5.10) and C3 permutations in staircase form (Proposition 5.11).

Proof. Conjecture 2.19 is false by Theorem 5.4.
For Conjecture 2.18, suppose it holds.
Then
by Lemma 5.12, every permutation in C3 is a mismatch-free product of Toffoli gates, up to Clifford
permutations on the left and right.
This implies that every permutation in C3 is semi-Clifford
by Lemma B.1. This is a contradiction, as we know U3 is a non-semi-Clifford permutation in C3
for n = 7.

Proof. We show the contrapositive. Suppose U′ = U⊗I2m is semi-Clifford. Consider the subgroup G
of Pn+m consisting of all P such that U′P(U′)−1 ∈Pn+m. We know by Lemma 2.4 that G contains 
a maximal abelian subgroup A of Pn+m. Let B = ⟨Zn+1, . . . , Zn+m⟩⊆G. Using Lemma A.2, we   
get a maximal abelian subgroup A′ of Pn+m such that B ⊆A′ ⊆⟨A, B⟩⊆G. Thus, there exists a   
subgroup A1 of Pn with A′ = ⟨A1, B⟩. We can see that A1 must have at least 2n elements up to
phase, so it must be a maximal abelian subgroup of Pn. So UA1U−1 ⊆Pn, which means that U is

Proof. We already know from Section 5.3 that there exists a non-semi-Clifford permutation in C3
on 7 qubits. Let us show this is minimal. Suppose π is a non-semi-Clifford permutation in C3 on n
qubits. Write π = ϕ1µϕ2 as in Theorem 3.2. If µ were semi-Clifford, then π would be semi-Clifford;
thus µ is non-semi-Clifford. Then Proposition A.4 implies that, in the descending multiplication
corresponding to µ, there exist i, j, k with eiejek ̸= 0. These must be pairwise distinct (aas e2

Proof. For the “if” direction, π being semi-Clifford follows from Lemma B.1, and π ∈Ck+1 follows
directly from Theorem 2.17 (along with part 2 of Fact 2.2).
For the “only if” direction, we apply Theorem B.2 to get a representation ϕ1µϕ2 where ϕ1 and
ϕ2 are Clifford permutations and µ is a mismatch-free product of C∗X gates. As any two gates
in such a product commutes, and every such gate is its own inverse, we can assume without loss
of generality that no gate is repeated. By part 2 of Fact
