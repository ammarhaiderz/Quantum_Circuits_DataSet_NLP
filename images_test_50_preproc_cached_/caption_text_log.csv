The lowest attainable two-photon emission probability of the source increases with the size of the leakage |x|. The best results are obtained for leaked fields which have destructive interference with the field emitted from the emitter θ=0. Full curves corresponds to the unfiltered case, while dashed curves corresponds to a Lorentzian frequency filter of width γ=1.66Γ. The dash-dotted line shows f(x)=|x| to indicate the scaling. 
Inset: Corresponding optimal pulse duration σ for minimum two-photon emission, as a function of leakage amplitude |x|. With lower leakage fraction |x|, we have less influence of the leaked field, and it is thus desirable to work with a shorter pulses duration to eliminate multiple excitations of the emitter. For some of the results for the filtered case, the minimum is at σ→ 0.

    The underlying true lifetime (dashed grey) is set to Θ/t = 1 (top) and Θ/t = 0.26 (bottom). 
    Insets (a), (b) show the typical convergence of estimates with the number of measurements. 
    As before, the different strategies can give different results for a small dataset, but become practically equivalent for larger numbers of data.

Each continuous fluorescent signal corresponds to a quantum trajectory which carries information on the unknown parameter, θ, encoded on the state of the open-system acting as a sensor. An ensemble average over all such trajectories leads to an evolution of the sensor described by a standard Lindblad master equation (see main text). (b) Collisional model describing the discrete Markovian time dynamics of a quantum system. Left panel: At each instance the system of interest (in red), here a single qubit,  “collides"" with a different ancillary two-level system  (in blue), always prepared in the same ground state, for a time interval Δ t. In turn, the corresponding ancilla is measured in the computational basis giving rise to a conditional discretized stochastic evolution of the system. Right panel: Instead of multiple ancillae, an equivalent description involves a single ancilla that is repeatedly re-initialized to the ground state after each measurement. In both cases, when the system-ancilla interaction is weak and occurs over infinitesimal time intervals (see main text), the discrete-time dynamics converges to a continuous-time limit, recovering the behavior described in panel (a).",collision model approach continu measur scheme continu measur radiat quanta emit open quantum interact bath continu fluoresc signal correspond quantum trajectori carri inform unknown paramet encod state open act sensor ensembl averag trajectori lead evolut sensor describ standard lindblad master equat main text b collision model describ discret markovian time dynam quantum left panel instanc red singl qubit collid differ ancillari twolevel blue prepar ground state time interv t turn correspond ancilla measur comput basi give rise condit discret stochast evolut right panel instead multipl ancilla equival descript involv singl ancilla repeatedli initi ground state measur case ancilla interact weak occur infinitesim time interv main text discret time dynam converg continu time limit recov behavior describ panel,0.0,0.3092071889341773,18,9.0,4,communication_and_entanglement,0.0,,0.0,False,False,0.23209273993248142,0.0843699576945703,0.0932203810726419,0.3092071889341773

The more localised the initial state, the higher the intermediate peak of the entanglement entropy. Regardless of initial state, the mean-force Gibbs state is approached at long times, which, for weak coupling, is close to the local ground state. As in the Page curve, the entanglement entropy thus has to decrease; here, it saturates close to zero. In the inset the initial state is the local ground state, the maximum of the entanglement entropy (dot-dashed green) still reaches an intermediate maximum, but it is just slightly higher than the final value, as the dynamics is not very far from equilibrium, seen by the fidelity F with the local ground state staying close to one (dotted red).

We then add to this matrix a projector onto the boundary to enforce a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. We then add a projector onto the exterior portion, so that obtained linear system is not singular, placing zeros in the corresponding locations of the right hand side vector.
