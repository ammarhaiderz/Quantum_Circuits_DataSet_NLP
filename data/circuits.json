      "Logical circuit for a 5 CNOT, constant-depth CNOT-ladder on a 4×2 grid of qubits. The brackets surround qubits on the same row. The dashed lines separate the circuit into three parts: the first creates a Bell pair between the ancilla row and the second data row, the second consists of the CNOTs from the first two sections of the original circuit (Figure <ref>) being executed in parallel, and the third consists of the final CNOT from the original circuit, measurement, and classical correction.",
      "Logical Architecture Uniting Motion and In-Place Entanglement: Shor’s Algorithm, Constant-Depth CNOT Ladder, and Many-Hypercube Code Logical qubits are considered an essential component for achieving utility-scale quantum computation. Multiple recent demonstrations of logical qubits on neutral atoms have relied on coherent qubit motion into entangling zones. However, this architecture requires motion prior to every entangling gate, incurring significant cost in wall clock runtime and motion-related error accumulation. We propose and experimentally realize an alternative architecture which"

As a corollary, we construct a family of non-semi-Clifford permutation gates in staircase form such that each is in the third level but its inverse is in"

Among the current floor localization techniques, fingerprinting is the mainstream technology due to its accuracy in noisy environments. To achieve accurate floor localization in a building with many floors, we have to collect sufficient data on each floor, which needs significant storage and running"
