      "Logical circuit for a 5 CNOT, constant-depth CNOT-ladder on a 4×2 grid of qubits. The brackets surround qubits on the same row. The dashed lines separate the circuit into three parts: the first creates a Bell pair between the ancilla row and the second data row, the second consists of the CNOTs from the first two sections of the original circuit (Figure <ref>) being executed in parallel, and the third consists of the final CNOT from the original circuit, measurement, and classical correction.",
      "Logical Architecture Uniting Motion and In-Place Entanglement: Shor’s Algorithm, Constant-Depth CNOT Ladder, and Many-Hypercube Code Logical qubits are considered an essential component for achieving utility-scale quantum computation. Multiple recent demonstrations of logical qubits on neutral atoms have relied on coherent qubit motion into entangling zones. However, this architecture requires motion prior to every entangling gate, incurring significant cost in wall clock runtime and motion-related error accumulation. We propose and experimentally realize an alternative architecture which"
