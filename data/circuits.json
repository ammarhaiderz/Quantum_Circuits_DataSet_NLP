      "Logical Architecture Uniting Motion and In-Place Entanglement: Shor’s Algorithm, Constant-Depth CNOT Ladder, and Many-Hypercube Code Logical qubits are considered an essential component for achieving utility-scale quantum computation. Multiple recent demonstrations of logical qubits on neutral atoms have relied on coherent qubit motion into entangling zones. However, this architecture requires motion prior to every entangling gate, incurring significant cost in wall clock runtime and motion-related error accumulation. We propose and experimentally realize an alternative architecture which"
